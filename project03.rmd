### Question 1

```{python, linewidth=80}
import pandas as pd
myDF = pd.read_csv("/class/datamine/data/craigslist/vehicles.csv")
myDF.head()
```

### Question 2

```{python, linewidth=80}
myyears = myDF['year'].dropna().to_list()

# get a list containing each unique year
unique_years = list(set(myyears))

# for each year (key), initialize the value (value) to 0
my_dict = {}
for year in unique_years:
    my_dict[year] = 0
for year in myyears:
    my_dict[year] = my_dict[year] + 1
print(my_dict)
```

### Question 3

```{python, linewidth=80}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

my_dict.keys()
my_dict.values()
plt.bar(my_dict.keys(), my_dict.values())
plt.show()
plt.close()
# An example of a key would be 1912 has a value of 5.
print(my_dict[1912])
```

### Question 4

```{python, linewidth=80}
listA = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 12]
listB = [2, 1, 7, 7, 7, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

# 1. values in list A but not list B
# values in list A but not list B
print(set(listA) - set(listB))

# 2. values in listB but not list A
print(set(listB) - set(listA))

# 3. values in both lists
# values in both lists
print(set.intersection(set(listA),set(listB)))
```

### Question 5

```{python, linewidth=80}
states_list = list(myDF.loc[:, ["state", "lat", "long"]].dropna().to_records(index=False))

geoDict = {}
for my_triple in states_list:
  geoDict[my_triple[0]] = []

for i in states_list:
  geoDict[i[0]].append( (i[1], i[2]) )
```

### Question 6

```{python, linewidth=80}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

my_dict.keys()
my_dict.values()
plt.scatter(my_dict.keys(), my_dict.values(), color='red')
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Value");
plt.show()
plt.close()
```
